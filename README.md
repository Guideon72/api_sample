# Sample API project

## What is an API and what does it do?

API stands for Application Programming Interface. It allows one application to get or send data from
one application to another and can define actions to take when it is called.

In this case, the API is a simple web app that returns historical weather information from a local data folder, for a small group of weather stations in the EU.
